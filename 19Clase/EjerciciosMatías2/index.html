                                A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a
                                payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our
                                WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall,
                                it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!

                                A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving) spacecraft,
                                by analogy to the seaport for ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the
                                famous Cape Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated to take advantage
                                of the Earthâ€™s rotation for launch.

                                A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry
                                capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where
                                you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema,
                                and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
